# Duo-Tactile: Dynamic Tangible Interaction through Flexible Filament with Capacitive and Resistive Sensing

## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for implementing swept frequency capacitive sensing on conductive TPU (Thermoplastic Polyurethane) filament. Swept frequency capacitive sensing is a technique used to detect changes in capacitance across a range of frequencies, allowing for precise and dynamic touch or proximity sensing.

## Introduction
This project focuses on utilising swept frequency capacitive sensing (SFCS) on conductive TPU filament, enabling a variety of touch or proximity-based applications. The TPU filament is chosen for its flexible and elastic properties, making it suitable for applications where traditional rigid materials may not be ideal.
